== Modular Architecture

* define a module file structure convention and some pyton base classes for libs, header only, ... so that one does not need to rewrite the conan recipe everytime

- CMSIS

== CI/CD

== Build Automation
- azure
- travis
- github actions
- jenkins


== Quality-Built in
=== Code Analysis
* clangformat

* create build job
** use https://github.com/conan-io/conan-package-tools
** publish to binray

* Coverage Analysis
** in Build
** IDE Integration
** define coverage limits

* Code Analysis
** clang format
** iwyu
** Sonar
** ... others

* Docker
** publish disroop docker images
* Architecture
** create Modularized Architecture with
*** runtime
*** hal
*** hal implementation
*** bsp
*** drivers
*** Applications
*** other components

* continuous validation of releases with check sum on binary file


== Toolchain
