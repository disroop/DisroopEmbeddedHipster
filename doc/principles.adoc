== Build One
We try to build code one if ever possible. Thus leading to a use of *.o or *.a files.
This is achieved by using target in CMake and a clear API for each conan package.

We try to avoid of adding compile time dependencies for example by using #define BUFFER_SIZE 123 in a library.
By that a library mus get recompiled depending on the desired BUFFER_SIZE. Further such define hide dependencies. See STM-CMSIS
todo and link and causes the build the be longer in case many test need different configured valued for BUFFER_SIZE.
