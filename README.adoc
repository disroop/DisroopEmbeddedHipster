DisroopEmbeddedHipster is a showcase project which demonstrates how to create modern embedded applications with a modular architecture and implementing CI/CD practices.

These are the main Features:

* Focusing one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M[ARM Cortex-M]
* Using Docker to manage the toolchain
* Easy to setup developer environment in 10 seconds.
* Reproducible builds with a fully automated toolchain
* Use https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/[Conan as package manager]
* Use CMake in a https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/[Modern CMake] manner
* Use https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Conan+Repositories[Artifactory] to manage artifacts
* Modular Architecture
* Testing (Unittest, Conan Package-Tests, Test on the Hardware)
* Supported Frameworks (https://github.com/google/googletest[Gtest], https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2[Catch2], http://cpputest.github.io/[Cpputest])
* Use modern IDEs ( https://code.visualstudio.com/[VsCode] and https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/clion/[Clion])
* Build-In Quality
