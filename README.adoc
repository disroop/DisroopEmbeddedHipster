DisroopEmbeddedHipster is a showcase project which demonstrates how to create modern C/C++ embedded applications with a modular architecture and implementing CI/CD practices.


== Get started
To use the EmbeddedHipster project and start to develop you need to install the following tools on your computer:

* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker-Desktop]

* https://code.visualstudio.com[VsCode]

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[VsCode Plugin - Remote Container]

If those tools are installed clone the repo and open vscode in the repository.

```console
git clone https://github.com/disroop/DisroopEmbeddedHipster.git
cd ./DisroopEmbeddedHipster
code .
```
To start developing start the container with the remote container plugin.

== Features
* Reproducible and traceable builds with a fully automated toolchain
* traceability (git history, build history, hashes, ... , timeline in sonar, ...)
* Build-In Quality
** Code Analysis
** Coverage Analysis
** https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/disroop/projects?search=hipster[Sonar]
* Build Automation
** Project CLI with invoke
** https://github.com/disroop/DisroopEmbeddedHipster/actions[GitHub Actions]
** https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/services/devops/pipelines/[Azure-Pipelines -todo]
** https://www.jenkins.io/[Jenkins -todo]
* Artifact based software development process
** source->build->artifact (bin, reports, ..)
* Quality Gateways
* Standardisation of toolchain

To help developers to get immediatily feedback there is builtin quality in the IDE. For example linting tools or test coverage view.

== Tools

* Using https://hub.docker.com/u/disroop[Docker] to manage the toolchain
* Easy to setup developer environment in 10 seconds.
* Use https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/[Conan as package manager]
* Use CMake in a https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/[Modern CMake] manner
* Use https://disroop.jfrog.io/[Artifactory] to manage artifacts
* Modular Architecture
* Testing (Unittest, Conan Package-Tests, Test on the Hardware)
* Supported unit testing frameworks (https://github.com/google/googletest[Gtest], https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2[Catch2], http://cpputest.github.io/[Cpputest])
* Use modern IDEs ( https://code.visualstudio.com/[VsCode] and https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/clion/[Clion])

* Focusing on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M[ARM Cortex-M]
