== Introduction
The blinky project is an example project to demonstrate the embedded hipster showcase on an actual project. The source code is written in C code because we have seen that many embedded projects prefer to use C over {cpp}. However, all of the tools can be combined with {cpp} projects as well.

== Function
The blinky application detects rotation movement. If rotation movement is detected, the green led is switched on. If after 2 seconds of no movement detection, the green led is switched off. A rotation movement is detected if the device rotates above 10 degrees per second.

== HW-Platform
The blinky project uses the link:https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html[B-L475E-IOT01A]
 Board from STMicroelectronics. The B-L475E-IOT01A Board has a STM32L4 Microcontroller with onboard low-power wireless connection interfaces like ble, nfc, wifi. It also comes with onboard sensors (gyro, accelerometer, temp, ..). With these features, the board is perfectly suited for IoT showcases.

== Conan dependencies
The conan dependencies show on which conan packages the blinky application depends on. It shows that there are a lot more dependencies when compiling for the target architecture (B-L475E-IOT01A Board) than for unit tests.

=== Target Platform (Release build)
The following diagram shows the dependency graph of the blinky project build for the target platform.

All of the target conan package dependencies are developed and maintained by link:https://www.disroop.ch[Disroop] and can be found in the following GitHub repository link:https://github.com/disroop/DisroopConanPackages[DisroopConanPackages].

=== Target Utest 
The following diagram shows the dependency graph of the blinky project build to run unit tests.

We use gtest to run unit tests. gtest is an official conan package and maintained by the conan community. It can be found in the following repository link:https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index[Conan-Center-Index].

== Cmake targets
The cmake graph shows the dependency of the libraries of the blinky application. This diagram shows more content than the conan dependency because it also shows the internal package dependencies.

=== Target Platform (Release build)

The following diagram shows the cmake dependency graph of the blinky app for the target build.

=== Target Utest 

The following diagram shows the cmake dependency graph of the blinky app build for utest.
